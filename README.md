# NNHandWritingClassification

An example of a Neural Network architecture using boosting techniques to increase accuracy
The models included uses the hand writtern letter and digit dataset, NIST Special Database 19, from NIST: https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19
The dataset is not included in the data folder and must be installed and placed in the folder

## Requirements

In addition to the dataset being in the data folder, the code requires the following:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Sci-kit Learn
4. Matplotlib
7. Tensorflow
8. Keras

To install all of these, open the python console and run the following code in the console:

	pip install numpy
	pip install pandas
	pip install -U scikit-learn
	pip install matplotlib
	pip install tensorflow
	pip install keras
